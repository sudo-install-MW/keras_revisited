# Task classify dogs and cats
Train a classifier to classify images of dog and cat.

# Branches
There is 4 branch in the repo which consist of sub task
1. task1 basic cnn model
2. task2 basic model with data augmentation
3. task3 transfer learning model
4. task4 fine-tuning pretrained model

### Dataset
4000 images of cats and dogs. 2000 for training, 
1000 for validation and 1000 for testing.


### Model
A simple model trained without regularization

### Extension
1. Issue of overfitting will be addressed with the help of data augmentation.
2. Feature extraction with a pretrained network
3. Fine tuning a pretrained network
